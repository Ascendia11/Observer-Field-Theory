# Observer-Field-Theory

Observer Field Theory (OFT) is a framework that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity through a Universal Informational Field (UIF). It proposes that reality emerges from interactions between observers and this field, with gravity acting as a universal decoherence channel. This repository is a hub for exploring OFT’s core technical documents.

Key Documents

: The foundational framework unifying quantum mechanics and gravity.

: Computational validation of OFT, exploring how observer precision shapes information extraction.

: Simulations showing gravity’s measurable effects on quantum information, including a 26.6% reduction in mutual information.
