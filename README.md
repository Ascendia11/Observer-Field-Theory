### 🔍 Overview

This release presents **Observer Field Theory (OFT)** — a unifying scientific framework proposing that consciousness is not emergent from matter or computation, but is the **recursive collapse of entangled informational structure**. In OFT, the observer is not *within* reality; **reality arises from the observer’s precision-weighted collapse**.

### 🌍 Observer Field Theory: General Relativity Derived from Quantum Informational Collapse  
📅 Published April 3, 2025  
👤 Pham, Thomas | [ORCID: 0009-0006-1702-764X](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-1702-764X)

This paper presents the **full derivation of General Relativity** from informational collapse within the Observer Field Theory (OFT) framework. It demonstrates how a differentiable spacetime manifold, the Einstein-Hilbert action, and Einstein’s field equations all **emerge directly from coherence-weighted entanglement structure**—without invoking any geometric priors.

#### 📐 Key Contributions:
- **Spacetime = informational coherence**, not a fundamental manifold  
- **Metric, curvature tensors, and gravitational action** derived from UIF topology  
- **Gravity = recursive collapse residue** — not a quantized force  
- Provides **a complete, falsifiable alternative** to quantizing general relativity  
- Testable predictions across:
  - **Cosmology** (CMB anomalies, soliton decay spectra)  
  - **Quantum decoherence** (observer-driven entropy gradients)  
  - **High-energy physics** (Higgs self-coupling deviation)

>  *Rather than quantizing gravity, OFT dissolves it into its informational source.*

## 🌑 Observer Field Theory: *A New Paradigm for Dark Matter via Quantum Informational Collapse*

This newly published paper introduces a radical reinterpretation of dark matter—not as a substance, but as a **topological memory of informational collapse**. Through a simulation-driven approach, the study reveals how **informational solitons**, formed via entanglement collapse within quantum graphs, replicate the gravitational effects attributed to dark matter.

### 🧬 Highlights:
- **Dark matter = solitonic curvature anomalies**, not particles  
- **Simulations from n = 3–16 nodes** show emergence of stable, memory-retaining structures  
- **Reproduces halo profiles, lensing distortions, and early-universe anisotropies**  
- **Predicts Ω<sub>soliton</sub> ≈ 0.26**, matching Planck satellite estimates  
- **Offers falsifiable observational predictions**: lensing asymmetries, CMB cold spots, soliton decay spectra

This is the **first quantum information-based model** of dark matter supported by entanglement-driven geometry.

## 🧠 Observer Field Theory: A Measurable Unification of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity

This paper introduces **Observer Field Theory (OFT)** — a simulation-validated framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through *informational structure*. Instead of treating space, time, or fields as fundamental, OFT models physics as emergent from the **Universal Informational Field (UIF)**: a dynamically evolving hypergraph of quantum entanglement.

### 🔬 Key Contributions:
- **Derivation of Einstein’s Field Equations** from entanglement area laws  
- **Testable Higgs self-coupling deviation**: Δλ ≈ 0.07  
- **Dark matter as UIF solitonic topological defects**  
- **Neutrino flavors as entangled winding sectors**  
- **Inflation from informational symmetry-breaking — no scalar fields**  
- **Seven-layer simulation validation** (QFI, entropy, trace distance, Bayesian model comparison, and more)  
- **Experimental roadmap across four domains (2025–2035)**: qubits, Higgs, neutrinos, and gamma rays

All results are generated via internal OFT simulation pipelines with deterministic timestamps.  
Public code access will follow peer-reviewed release milestones.

## 🌀 Observer Field Theory: *Emergent Spacetime from Entanglement* — A Simulation-Based Validation

This companion paper presents the **first public validation suite** for Observer Field Theory using direct simulation of emergent spacetime geometry.

### 📐 Key Features:
- **3-node, 8-node, and 14-node quantum networks**
- **Metric tensors and Ricci scalar curvature** derived from entanglement structure via the Observer Field Equation (OFE)
- **Directional information flow**, curvature anisotropy, and entropy-driven geodesics — all without coordinate-based assumptions

These simulations demonstrate that **spacetime geometry itself can emerge from entangled informational dynamics**.
