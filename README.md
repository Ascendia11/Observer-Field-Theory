🌌 Observer Field Theory (OFT)

*Unifying Quantum Mechanics and Gravity through the Universal Informational Field (UIF)*

This repository serves as the core documentation hub for Observer Field Theory (OFT), a new theoretical framework proposing that spacetime and gravity emerge from entanglement structure and observer interactions with an underlying universal informational field.

## 🧠 Observer Field Theory: A Measurable Unification of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity

This paper introduces **Observer Field Theory (OFT)** — a simulation-validated framework that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology through *informational structure*. Instead of treating space, time, or fields as fundamental, OFT models physics as emergent from the **Universal Informational Field (UIF)**: a dynamically evolving hypergraph of quantum entanglement.

### 🔬 Key Contributions:
- **Derivation of Einstein’s Field Equations** from entanglement area laws  
- **Testable Higgs self-coupling deviation**: Δλ ≈ 0.07  
- **Dark matter as UIF solitonic topological defects**  
- **Neutrino flavors as entangled winding sectors**  
- **Inflation from informational symmetry-breaking — no scalar fields**  
- **Seven-layer simulation validation** (QFI, entropy, trace distance, Bayesian model comparison, and more)  
- **Experimental roadmap across four domains (2025–2035)**: qubits, Higgs, neutrinos, and gamma rays

All results are generated via internal OFT simulation pipelines with deterministic timestamps.  
Public code access will follow peer-reviewed release milestones.

## 🌀 Observer Field Theory: *Emergent Spacetime from Entanglement* — A Simulation-Based Validation

This companion paper presents the **first public validation suite** for Observer Field Theory using direct simulation of emergent spacetime geometry.

### 📐 Key Features:
- **3-node, 8-node, and 14-node quantum networks**
- **Metric tensors and Ricci scalar curvature** derived from entanglement structure via the Observer Field Equation (OFE)
- **Directional information flow**, curvature anisotropy, and entropy-driven geodesics — all without coordinate-based assumptions

These simulations demonstrate that **spacetime geometry itself can emerge from entangled informational dynamics**.
