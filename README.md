# Observer-Field-Theory

Observer Field Theory (OFT) is a framework that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity through a Universal Informational Field (UIF). It proposes that reality emerges from interactions between observers and this field, with gravity acting as a universal decoherence channel. This repository is a hub for exploring OFT’s core technical documents.
